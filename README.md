# Itheum Data Assets

A curated list of free data assets that can be used to test and bootstrap the data trading features of the Itheum Data DEX. These are a curated list of "free and public" datasets so they should ONLY be used for testing the Data DEX's Data NFT features and not for actual sale on the Mainnet Data DEX (as this will violate the **terms of use** as these datasets are not your "original work"); but if you are a data analyst, data scientist, or someone who just loves data - then why not use these free datasets and create your own custom visualizations or data views on top of the base data. These custom visualizations or data views can then be sold on the live Data DEX as its "original work" (you are the Data Creator).

## Data Catalog

Below is the catalog of available data assets. You will find assets in various formats (JSON, CSV, PDF etc.) and each has it's own _Details_ link so you can learn more about the original dataset. To mint a Data NFT in the Data DEX, you can use the below "Data Stream" link as the "Data Stream URL" and you can use the associated "Data Preview" link as the "Data Preview URL" in the "Trade my Data" screen of the Data DEX.
