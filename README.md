# Itheum Data Assets
A repository of data assets that can be used to test and bootstrap the data trading features of the Itheum Data DEX.

## How can I use these files?
You can get a public raw link for any data assets within this repo and use it as the "Data Stream URL" in the "trade my data" screen. You can use the associated "_preview" file as the "Data Preview URL". Let's look at how you can use the files to mint a "Data NFT".
